How to use:
1. extract all files to a new directory with your cipher.c source code.
(it is advised not to use your project's directory as it can cause some mess)
2. Run ex1_test.exe.
3. Press Enter to exit.

this will run both Ori Levi's tests and mine.
ther is no need to run any other file other than ex1_test.exe

Keep in mind that if you pass this test it does not guarantee you will pass all the tests written by
the course staff.

One last thing, the tests for checks need to be done "manually". it took me too long to try and get
the stdout of the program to a string and I gave up on it.
so just scroll over the output in the terminal and check if all output is as expected.
